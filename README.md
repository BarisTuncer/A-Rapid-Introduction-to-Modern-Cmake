# Lab 1

We have included another file **[anothermain.c](Driver/anothermain.c)** inside the `Driver` folder.

With this current form of the project, CMake will create only the executable called `main`. Convince yourself
by building the project that there is only one executable `main` will be generated.

Your task is add another executible called `anothermain` by updating **[CMakeLists.txt](Driver/CMakeLists.txt)**
inside the `Driver` folder. Be sure to build and run both executables.
