Let's switch to **[Step1]** branch.
# Hello Modern CMake

In this project we simply want to compile **[main.c]** which wants to say hello to Modern CMake.

## Global set up 

CMake starts its journey by checking the **[Step1/CMakeLists.txt]** inside the top project folder which is `NonTrivialCMakeExp` in our case.

We start by investigating this file:

* `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.18)` : Sets the minimum required version of cmake for a project. You can 
check your own version of CMake by `cmake --version` in the terminal.

* `set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 11)` : Sets the `C_STANDARD` variable to 11 for all targets

* `set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON)` : If `CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED` is OFF or unset, the `C_STANDARD` target property is treated 
as optional and may “decay” to a previous standard if the requested is not available.

* `project(NonTrivialCMakeExample)` : Sets the name of our project

* `add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra)` : [**WARNING**] This is a global setting. Act for all targets in the current directory and below that are added after this command is invoked. We should keep the global settings at a minimum level.

* `add_subdirectory(Driver)` tells CMake to switch to the Driver directory and continue from the **[Step1/Driver/CMakeLists.txt]** which resides inside the **[Step1/Driver]** folder. 

## Preparing make file to compile main

Now CMake continues its journey by checking **[Step1/Driver/CMakeLists.txt]** inside the **[Step1/Driver]** folder.

We start by naming this sub-project as `driver` by declaring `project(driver)`.

The file **[main.c]** wants to say hello to Modern CMake. As you can see
adding the executable which accomplish this task is fairly simple.
We just add 

* `add_executable(main ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/main.c)` command.

`PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR` inside the Driver/CMakeLists.txt macro refers to the 
source directory for the `current` sub-project `driver` which is simply the folder `Driver` in our case.
So the executable main will be generated by the file **[main.c]**.

## Building main (on Linux or Mac)

CMake is a program that produces an output. If we call it from the project directory `NonTrivialCMakeExp` then
it will produce its output into the `NonTrivialCMakeExp`. We don't want to pollute our project directory. So, 

1. We create a new directory for the output, say build, by `mkdir build`. 
2. Next `cd build` 
3. Finally `cmake ..`, i.e. from the `build` directory, we tell CMake to act on the parent directory `NonTrivialCMakeExp`and produce its output inside the `build` directory. 

Now, if there was no error, `make` file is created inside the `build` directory for us. Now we can run `make`, checkout to the
`Driver` folder inside `build` and run the executable main: `./main`. 

Now you are ready to go to **[Lab1](https://github.com/BarisTuncer/A-Rapid-Introduction-to-Modern-Cmake/tree/Lab1)** to get your hands dirty

You can compare your solution with the solution branch **[Sol1](https://github.com/BarisTuncer/A-Rapid-Introduction-to-Modern-Cmake/tree/Sol1)**

## Building main (on Windows)

If you are using VSCode or Visual Studio you can use plugin for CMake to generate the `main.exe` for you. 
In case you wonder how to generate it on command line:

1. `mkdir build` (if you want to delete already existing `build` folder: `rd /s /q build`)
2. `cd build`
3. `cmake ..` (this will generate a `sln` file inside `build`. In our case is it is called `NonTrivialCMakeExample.sln`)
4. `devenv NonTrivialCMakeExample.sln /Build` (This will create `main.exe` in `build\Debug`)

NOte: You may need to add the folder which contains `devenv` into your envronment path: In my case it is in: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2019\Community\Common7\IDE` folder
