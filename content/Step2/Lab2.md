Let's switch to **[Lab2]** branch.

We have created a new folder called **[Lab2/Libraries]** and included 2 libraries inside of it

* **[Lab2/Libraries/Csapp]** library which needs to be compiled and linked with `pthread` library.

* **[Lab2/Libraries/Log]** library from `Step2` which needs to be compiled.

You task is update all `CMakeLists.txt` files in the **[Lab2]** branch so that **[Lab2/Driver/main.c]** can access and get the taste of these 2 libraries.
